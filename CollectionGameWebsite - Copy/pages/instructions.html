    <h1>Collection Game Instrustions</h1>
    <p>The goal of this game is too collect gold coins while avoiding all the red enemies. You have a total of 5 lives. Everytime you touch an enemy one life is taken. Overtime, powerups will spawn and can help you survive. There are two types of powerups, the time slow powerup and the shield powerup. The slow time one makes everything slow down and the shield one makes the enemies not able to kill you. The slow time one spawns every 20 seconds and the shield one spawns every 25 seconds. They both last 10 seconds. </p><br>
