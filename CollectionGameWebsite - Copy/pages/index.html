    <p>Collection game is a game we made throughout the course of several weeks. For the first 1-2 weeks we made the basics of the game and followed a video or google doc on what to do. After, for another 1 week we created enhancements and powerups for the game. Once we finished that we learned how to use a pixel art app called pixel and used it to create art and animations for out games. I really enjoyed making this game and I hope we are able to do more things similar to thing and continue to use construct to create games.</p>
